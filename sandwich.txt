Do you really want to flirt with me?
Do you really see eye to eye?
Now I am going to make a list of how to make a sandwhich.
1. Take 2 pieces of bread and lay them side by side.
2. Spread peanut butter on one piece of bread.
3. Spread jelly on the other piece of bread.
4. Now put both pieces of bread together.
5. Finally, cut the sandwich in half.
